Detecting Fraudulent Users in the Bitcoin and Amazon Networks:  An SNA-Based Approach using Fairness and Goodness

For example, if a user consistently rates a 5 star-deserving product as 5 star and 1 star deserving product as 1-star, then the user is fair. And a high quality (good) product gets  high ratings from highly fair users. Whereas if a user rates a 1-star deserving products  5-star and a 5-star deserving product as 1-star then the user is not fair.
